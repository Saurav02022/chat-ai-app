# Getting Started with JobCraft AI Development

Welcome to the JobCraft AI development journey! This guide will help you get started with the 26-day development plan.

## Quick Start

1. **Read the Product Vision**: Start with the main [README.md](../README.md) to understand what we're building
2. **Review the Overview**: Check [development-plan/README.md](./README.md) for the complete roadmap
3. **Start Day 1**: Begin with [Day 1: Project Setup](./day-01/README.md)

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: UI-First (Days 1-20)

Build the complete application with:

- **Local Storage**: All data stored in browser
- **Mock Authentication**: Demo login without backend
- **Full Functionality**: All features working end-to-end
- **No Backend Required**: Focus on UI/UX and features

**Why UI-First?**

- Faster iteration and testing
- See features immediately
- No backend setup delays
- Easy to demo and get feedback
- Backend integration becomes a straightforward migration

### Phase 2: Backend Integration (Days 21-26)

Migrate to production-ready backend:

- **Supabase**: Database, auth, and file storage
- **Real Authentication**: Google OAuth
- **Data Migration**: Move from localStorage to database
- **Production Deployment**: Deploy to Vercel

## Daily Workflow

### Weekdays (Monday-Friday, after 7 PM)

**Time Available**: 2-3 hours

**Focus Areas**:

- UI components
- Testing and polish
- Bug fixes
- Documentation
- Lighter features

**Tips**:

- Have a clear goal before starting
- Focus on one feature at a time
- Test as you build
- Commit frequently
- Don't start complex features

### Weekends (Saturday-Sunday)

**Time Available**: Full day (6-8 hours)

**Focus Areas**:

- Complex features (AI integration, audio processing)
- Backend setup
- Major refactoring
- Comprehensive testing
- Multiple related features

**Tips**:

- Plan the day in advance
- Take regular breaks
- Tackle hardest tasks first
- Test thoroughly
- Review and refine

## Using This Development Plan

### Each Day Includes

1. **Goal**: Clear objective for the day
2. **Prerequisites**: What must be done first
3. **Tasks Checklist**: Detailed step-by-step tasks with checkboxes
4. **Deliverables**: Expected outputs
5. **Success Criteria**: How to verify completion
6. **Time Breakdown**: Estimated time for each task
7. **Tips & Solutions**: Common issues and best practices

### How to Use the Checklists

- [ ] Read the entire day's plan before starting
- [ ] Check off tasks as you complete them
- [ ] Don't skip tasks (they build on each other)
- [ ] Test after each major task
- [ ] Commit to Git after completing sections
- [ ] Mark the day complete when all tasks are done
- [ ] Record actual time spent for future reference

## Development Environment Setup

### Required Tools

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js
- **Git**: For version control
- **Code Editor**: VS Code recommended
- **Browser**: Chrome or Firefox (with DevTools)

### Recommended VS Code Extensions

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
- GitLens
- Error Lens

### Initial Setup (Before Day 1)

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saurav02022/chat-ai-app.git
   cd chat-ai-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local`

4. **Test Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open http://localhost:3000

5. **Verify Everything Works**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run lint
   ```

## Key Technologies to Learn

### Essential (Learn First)

- **Next.js 15**: App Router, Server Components, Client Components
- **TypeScript**: Types, interfaces, generics
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility classes, responsive design
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library usage

### Important (Learn as Needed)

- **Zustand**: State management
- **TanStack Query**: Data fetching
- **React Hook Form**: Form handling
- **Zod**: Schema validation
- **Framer Motion**: Animations

### Advanced (Learn for Specific Features)

- **OpenAI API**: AI integration
- **Web Audio API**: Audio processing
- **Web Speech API**: Speech recognition
- **Supabase**: Backend services

## Best Practices

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Use strict mode, avoid `any`
- **Components**: Keep them small and focused
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent names
- **Comments**: Explain why, not what
- **Testing**: Test as you build

### Git Workflow

- **Commits**: Make small, focused commits
- **Messages**: Write clear commit messages
- **Branches**: Use feature branches for major work
- **Push**: Push to remote regularly

### Performance

- **Images**: Optimize before using
- **Code Splitting**: Use dynamic imports for large components
- **Memoization**: Use React.memo for expensive components
- **Lazy Loading**: Load components only when needed

### Accessibility

- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML elements
- **ARIA Labels**: Add labels for screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all features are keyboard accessible
- **Color Contrast**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
