## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- **State**: Zustand + TanStack Query
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Backend**: Supabase (Phase 2)

### Key Libraries

- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **PDF**: pdf-parse, jsPDF, Puppeteer
- **Audio**: Web Audio API, Web Speech API
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright

## Development Principles

1. **UI-First Approach**: Build and test UI before backend integration
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test features as you build them
3. **Mobile-First Design**: Start with mobile, scale up to desktop
4. **AI-Assisted Development**: Leverage Cursor AI for faster development
5. **User-Centric**: Focus on UX and user flow at every step

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Complete user flow from landing to live interview
- [ ] All features functional with localStorage (Day 1-20)
- [ ] Successful Supabase migration (Day 21-26)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive across all pages
- [ ] Real-time interview assistant working
- [ ] Production deployment successful

## Tips for Success

### Time Management

- **Weekdays**: Focus on lighter tasks (UI components, testing, polish)
- **Weekends**: Tackle complex features (AI integration, audio processing, backend)
- **Flexibility**: Adjust timeline based on progress and complexity

### Using Cursor AI

- Use for boilerplate code generation
- Leverage for component scaffolding
- Get help with debugging and optimization
- Ask for best practices and patterns

### Testing Strategy

- Test incrementally, don't wait until the end
- Focus on user flows, not just unit tests
- Test on multiple devices and browsers
- Use real data scenarios

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't skip localStorage phase - it's crucial for rapid iteration
- Don't over-engineer - keep it simple and functional
- Don't ignore mobile responsiveness
- Don't forget to test AI API costs
- Don't skip error handling

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check Next.js, Shadcn UI, and OpenAI docs
- **AI Assistant**: Use Cursor AI for code help
- **Community**: Next.js Discord, Reddit r/nextjs
- **Issues**: Track blockers and questions as you go

## Progress Tracking

Mark each day as complete when:

- [ ] All tasks checked off
- [ ] Deliverables produced
- [ ] Success criteria met
- [ ] Code committed to Git
- [ ] Ready for next day
