- [x] Save the file
- [ ] Install Prettier VS Code extension (if using VS Code)
- [ ] Test formatting on an existing file (try formatting `app/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Verify formatting works correctly

### **Step 5: Enhance ESLint Configuration**

- [ ] Open `.eslintrc.json` file in project root
- [ ] Verify it exists and has basic Next.js configuration
- [ ] Confirm `eslint-config-prettier` is in the extends array
- [ ] Run: `npm run lint` to test ESLint
- [ ] Verify no conflicts between ESLint and Prettier

### **Step 6: Initialize Husky Git Hooks**

- [x] Run: `npx husky init`
- [x] Verify `.husky` folder is created
- [x] Check that `.husky/_/husky.sh` file exists
- [x] Verify `package.json` has `"prepare": "husky"` script

### **Step 7: Create Pre-commit Hook**

- [x] Create file `.husky/pre-commit`
- [x] Configure it to run lint-staged before commits
- [x] Make the file executable: `chmod +x .husky/pre-commit`
- [x] Verify the file has execute permissions

### **Step 8: Configure Lint-staged**

- [x] Create file `.lintstagedrc.js` in project root
- [x] Configure it to run ESLint and Prettier on staged files
- [x] Set up rules for TypeScript/JavaScript files and other file types
- [x] Save the file
- [ ] Test by staging a file and attempting a commit

### **Step 9: Verify Environment Variables**

- [ ] Check if `.env.local` file exists in project root
- [ ] If it doesn't exist, create `.env.local`
- [ ] Verify it contains `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- [ ] Add placeholder comments for future Supabase and email configuration
- [ ] Save the file
- [ ] Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`

---

## üìÅ **PHASE 3: PROJECT STRUCTURE SETUP**

### **Step 10: Create Utility Directories**

- [x] Create `types` folder in project root: `mkdir types`
- [x] Create `hooks` folder in project root: `mkdir hooks`
- [x] Create `contexts` folder in project root: `mkdir contexts`
- [x] Verify `lib` folder already exists
- [x] Verify `components/ui` folder already exists
- [x] Verify `app/api` folder already exists

### **Step 11: Create TypeScript Definitions**

- [x] Create file `types/index.ts`
- [x] Set up basic type definitions for User, Job, and API responses
- [x] Define enums for JobStatus and JobPriority
- [x] Include interfaces for future authentication and job management features
- [x] Save the file
- [ ] Verify TypeScript recognizes the types

### **Step 12: Create Hooks Directory Structure**

- [x] Create file `hooks/index.ts`
- [x] Set up basic export structure for future custom hooks
- [x] Add placeholder comments for future useAuth and useJobs hooks
- [x] Save the file

### **Step 13: Create Contexts Directory Structure**

- [x] Create file `contexts/index.ts`
- [x] Set up basic export structure for future context providers
- [x] Add placeholder comments for future AuthProvider and JobsProvider
- [x] Save the file

### **Step 14: Verify Existing Utility Files**

- [x] Check that `lib/utils.ts` exists
- [x] Verify it contains the `cn()` function for class merging
- [x] Check that `lib/supabase.ts` exists
- [x] Verify Supabase client configuration is present

## üß™ **PHASE 4: TESTING & VALIDATION**

### **Step 15: Test Development Server**

- [ ] Start development server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify server starts on http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Check terminal for any startup errors
- [ ] Open browser and navigate to localhost:3000
- [ ] Verify existing chat interface loads correctly
- [ ] Check that Tailwind CSS styles are applied
- [ ] Test any existing components render properly
- [ ] Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Stop the development server

### **Step 16: Test Development Tools**

- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Verify no critical errors are reported
- [ ] Fix any linting issues if found
- [ ] Test Prettier formatting on a file
- [ ] Make a small change to a file and stage it
- [ ] Attempt a commit to test pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Verify hooks run and check code quality
- [ ] Complete or cancel the test commit

### **Step 17: Verify Project Structure**

- [ ] Check that all created directories exist:
  - [ ] `types` folder
  - [ ] `hooks` folder
  - [ ] `contexts` folder
- [ ] Verify essential files are in place:
  - [ ] `types/index.ts`
  - [ ] `hooks/index.ts`
  - [ ] `contexts/index.ts`
- [ ] Test TypeScript type imports in a test file
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript compilation errors

### **Step 18: Test File Imports and Exports**

- [ ] Test importing from `types/index.ts` in an existing file
- [ ] Test importing from `lib/utils.ts` in an existing file
- [ ] Verify all imports work correctly
- [ ] Check that TypeScript compilation has no errors
